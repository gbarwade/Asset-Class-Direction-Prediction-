# Asset-Class-Direction-Prediction-
The aim of this project is to predict direction of the Assets using macro-economic features and factors such as volatility and momentum.
The Project is divided into three steps 
1) Data Exploration - Finding relationship between different assets, macro-economic variables and assets and macroeconomic variables  
2) Creating different features such as momentum and volatality with rate of return
3) Creting time dependent model architecture such as future rate of return architecture 
4) Using time series traing startegies and time series cross validation
5) Asset class direction prediction - Classification Problem
6) Asset class rate of return prediction - Regression Problem
7) Comparing two problems and conclusion
